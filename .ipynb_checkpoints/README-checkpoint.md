BatCat is designed to help data scientists to practice machine learning operations (MLOps) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Services of AWS covered:

1. **AWS Lambda**: a serverless, event-driven compute service
2. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: provides object storage service
3. **Amazon Athena**: a serverless, interactive query service on S3
4. **Amazon Redshift**: a data warehouse product
5. **Amazon SageMaker Processing**: allows you to run steps for data pre- or post-processing, feature engineering, data validation, or model evaluation workloads on Amazon SageMaker.
6. **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, share, and deploy container images.
7. **AWS Step Functions**: a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services.
8. **Secret Manager**: is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data.

Philosophy of BatCat's MLOps
---

BatCat practices MLOps in **3 layers (ASA)**:

1. **Algorithm level**: which is on machine learning algorithm itself, it cares about learning curve, iteration rounds, metrics, etc. 
2. **System level**: which treats the machine learning project as a system itself, it focuses on resources ultized and health of the machine learning pipeline.
3. **Application level**: which put the machine learning system as one of parts in a large process, it connects data producers from upstream and data consumers from downstreams.
